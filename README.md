# The reactive essence of React

## Your task

You are presented with a simple currency exchange web application.
The value is supposed to be converted as the user types in either field.

Use the provided components as is. All your code should go in `App.js` only.

Good luck!

> To test your work, run `yarn test` in the project directory.

## Why?

Ever thought why is React called React?

Well, the answer is right there; becausse React reacts to user-induced changes.

State is React's nervous system. Without the state, React is just getting in the way.

The idea behind the state is to define the dynamic parts of the app.
Anything kept in the state is automatically under React's radar, and whenever it changes in the code, it changes on the browser!
